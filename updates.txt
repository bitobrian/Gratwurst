1.2.9 - Fixed an issue where users of an early version may have had unit 
        names with whitespace stored, allowing for self congratulations to
        persist.
1.2.8 - Fixed issue where players on realms with whitespace in the name would
        congratulate themselves.  No room for that sort of egotism here.
1.2.6 - Add "/gw c" command to open configuration window. Official changelog.
